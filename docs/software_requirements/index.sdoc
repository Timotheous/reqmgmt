[SECTION]
TITLE: Mutex

[REQUIREMENT]
UID: ZEP-91
STATUS: Draft
TYPE: Functional
COMPONENT: Mutex
TITLE: Mutex Kernel Object
STATEMENT: >>>
The Zephyr RTOS shall support resource synchronization. (Note synchronization can be for memory access, and mutex may be one implementation, but not the only one).
<<<
USER_STORY: >>>
As a Zephyr RTOS user I want to be able to sychonize threads when accessing common resources, where the thread shall have the option to:
- wait eternally until the resources becomes available.
- immediately return with a negative message if the resource is not available and allow the thread to continue.
- wait for a given time for the resource to become available or return with a negative message.
<<<
REVIEW_COMMENT: >>>
Concern over phrase recursive.  What is it MUTEXing? Memory Management?
